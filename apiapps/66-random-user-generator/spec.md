# Random User Generator

## Tagline
Generate realistic, structured demo user data in one click so your team never ships a product with "John Doe" placeholders.

## Target Market
Product teams, UX designers, and QA engineers at SaaS companies and digital agencies who build and test data-driven interfaces.

## Problem
Teams waste time manually crafting fake user datasets for demos, staging environments, and QA test suites. Generic placeholder data makes presentations look unprofessional and fails to surface real-world edge cases like long names, international characters, or diverse profile photos. No single tool produces structured, exportable, realistic user sets at scale.

## Solution
The app generates configurable batches of realistic user profiles via the RandomUser API — controlling nationality, gender ratio, age range, and count — and exports the result as JSON, CSV, or SQL INSERT statements ready to drop into any database or prototype.

## Core Features (MVP)
- Batch user generation with configurable parameters (count, nationality, gender, age range)
- Real-time preview table of generated profiles
- Export as JSON, CSV, or SQL INSERT
- Field selector (choose which fields to include: name, email, avatar, address, phone, etc.)
- Saved presets for frequently used configurations

## API Used
- RandomUser API — realistic user profile data including names, addresses, avatars, emails, and phone numbers

## Monetization
Freemium — Free (up to 100 users/batch, 5 exports/day); $12/month (unlimited batches + all export formats + presets).

## Tech Stack Suggestion
Next.js + Supabase (auth + presets storage) + Tailwind CSS.

## MVP Scope
Included in v1: batch generation, parameter controls, preview table, JSON/CSV/SQL export, field selector, saved presets.
Out of scope: custom schema mapping, mock API hosting, Faker.js custom fields, team sharing, webhook delivery.
