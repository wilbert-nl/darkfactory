# UV Index Tracker for Outdoor Workers

## Tagline
Protect your crew with automated UV alerts that schedule safe sun exposure windows throughout the workday.

## Target Market
Small landscaping companies, roofing contractors, and outdoor event staffing firms with field crews working in high-sun environments.

## Problem
Outdoor workers face real health risks from prolonged UV exposure, yet most job sites have no system to communicate UV conditions or enforce sun-safety breaks. Employers are increasingly liable for heat-related and UV-related illnesses but lack an affordable, simple tool to manage compliance. Manual UV monitoring is unrealistic on active job sites.

## Solution
A UV safety management tool where managers set up job sites by location and receive automated alerts when UV index crosses danger thresholds. Workers get scheduled break reminders and SPF reapplication nudges, and managers get a compliance log showing alert history.

## Core Features (MVP)
- Job site setup with location-based UV index monitoring
- Configurable UV threshold alerts (e.g., alert when UV >= 6)
- Automated email/SMS to site leads at threshold breach with recommended actions
- Hourly UV forecast display per site for the current workday
- Alert and acknowledgment log per site for compliance records

## API Used
- OpenWeatherMap UV API — provides current UV index and UV forecast data by geographic coordinates

## Monetization
SaaS subscription — $29/month for up to 3 job sites; $69/month for unlimited sites and SMS alerting.

## Tech Stack Suggestion
Next.js + Supabase + Resend + Twilio (SMS)

## MVP Scope
**Included in v1:** Site location setup, UV index polling (hourly), threshold-based email and SMS alerts, daily UV forecast view, alert history log.
**Out of scope:** Worker-facing mobile app, wearable sensor integration, OSHA reporting export, payroll or HR system sync.
